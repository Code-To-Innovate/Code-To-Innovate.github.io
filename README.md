Code To Innovate
Every one is a genius but if you judge a fish with its ability to cimb trees then it will leave its whole life believing that it is stupid and useless.
I believe that every individual in this worls has atleast one million dollar idea throughout hiss/her lifetime. 
But everyone dont work on it mostly the reason is lack of awareness and knowledge on how to implement that idea. 
But if that idea is virtual or software related then coding can be a way to make it happen.
