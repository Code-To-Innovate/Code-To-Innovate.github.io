"Every one is a genius but if you judge a fish with its ability to climb trees then it will live it's whole life believing that it is stupid and useless."-Albert Einstein

I believe that every individual in this world has atleast one million dollar idea throughout his/her lifetime. 
But everyone don't work on it and mostly the reason is lack of awareness and knowledge on how to implement that idea. 
But if that idea is virtual or software related then coding can act as a way to make it happen. 
So, this time Code To Innovate your way into contributing towards a better future.
